                        <p><strong>Poster 1</strong></p>
                        The sponsors are grouped together in the same proximity with some white space
                         surrounding them because they all relate to each other. The contrast of the 
                         black text on white makes it easy to read. The important text is aligned to the 
                         right and the extra information is centred and surrounded by hot air balloon images. 
                         The repetition of the same font with different weights keeps the poster looking professional. 
                        </div>
                    <div class="box1">

                        <p><strong>Poster 2</strong></p>
                        I chose the repetition of the circles for the sponsors because they are similar to the shape 
                        of the hot air balloon. The contrast of the white text on top of the blue background makes it
                         easier to read and is more aesthetic than black text on blue. I aligned the text to the right 
                         as I put the logo in the left corner because that is the first-place English readers would 
                         naturally look. All the text is in the same proximity.
                        </div>
                   
                </div>

                <div class="flexgrow-container">

                    <div class="box1">

                        <p><strong>Poster 3</strong></p>
                        The contrast between the green text and the black allows the date to stand out for people to clearly
                         see when it is. The repetition of the colour scheme matches the colours of the map, this makes the 
                         poster more aesthetically appealing. The text is aligned to the left. The sponsors are in the same 
                         area again because they are all related.
                        </div>

                    <strong>Final Poster</strong>
                        For the final poster I kept the repeating circles to give the effect of the sponsors being
                         more balloons in the sky. The contrasting white text in the Hobeaux font on the blue stayed. 
                         This is because it is easy to read and more aesthetically pleasing compared to black on blue. 
                         I aligned two of the three pieces of text information to the right because an English reader 
                         will automatically look to the logo in the left first. The text that is centred rather that 
                         aligned to the right would be another aspect of the poster readers would be drawn to, especially
                          because of the use of bold style. The text is no longer all in the same proximity because I 
                          moved the dates to the bottom of the poster to utilise the white space I had left before. It
                           also creates a triangle meaning the reader will look over all the poster which is better form
                            a marketing point of view.

                 <p>The coding worksheets were set every week
                     to allow us to learn HTML and eventually
                     CSS. The worksheets allowed us to develop
                     our skills every week and eventually
                      create our final website.</p>

                <img src="https://placebear.com/300/300">
                <div class="mediacontent">This worksheet investigated using GitHub, publishing the repository,
                     locating it in finder, locating it in GitHub and how to commit (save) work. It also briefly 
                     covered some simple HTML in visual studio code.</div>

                <div class="mediacontent">
                    In week 2 we covered the block elements <h> <p> as well as ordered (ol) and unordered 
                        (ol) lists. The worksheet also showed how to utilise the inline elements to make
                        certain text stand out. Adding an image was also included in this worksheet. 
                        Then, in week 3 on the same index page we added the CSS stylesheet. This developed
                         the website a bit more and made it look a bit nicer.

                <img src="https://placebear.com/300/300">
                <div class="mediacontent">In week 4 we looked at flexboxes, cantering images, adding audio 
                    and video to the website. As well as media content with accompanied text. 
                    Then in week 5 we turned the li into buttons for the website. As well as how to link buttons to other 
                    pages and parts of the website. It also covered changing the colour scheme and adding adobe and google fonts.

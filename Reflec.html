        <div class="section-two" id="section-two">
            <div class="RefPara">Coming into this course module I was very excited because I had some experience
                with coding but not really any experience with InDesign or Illustrator. I was enthusiastic to develop
                my HTML and CSS skills as well as learning how to use software that was new to me. . </div>

            <div class="RefPara">The first task sheet was the CARP posters. I didn’t really
                struggle with the CARP features for the 3 posters. For the final poster struggled
                slightly with using up all the white space. I enjoyed this task because I could be
                as creative as I wanted and input my own ideas into the poster. Then came the typography
                task which I didn’t really struggle with at all. I enjoyed this task because it was quite
                simple with no images and only being able to use 3 colours meant experimenting with different
                font weights and even shapes. At the same time, it was impressive to see all 8 typographic
                systems set up with the exact same text, yet they all looked so different. While completing
                these tasks we also had the weekly coding sheets. Each worksheet developed a range of different
                skills. These were helpful especially when it came to creating my own website. </div>

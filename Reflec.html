        <div class="section-two" id="section-two">
            <div class="RefPara">Coming into this course module I was very excited because I had some experience with
                coding but not
                really any experience with InDesign or Illustrator. I was enthusiastic to develop my HTML and CSS skills
                as well as
                learning how to use software that was new to me. </div>

            <div class="RefPara">The first task sheet was the CARP posters. I didn’t really struggle with the CARP
                features for the 3
                posters. For the final poster struggled slightly with using up all the white space. I enjoyed this task
                because I could
                be as creative as I wanted and input my own ideas into the poster. Then came the typography task which I
                didn’t really
                struggle with at all. I enjoyed this task because it was quite simple with no images and only being able
                to use 3 colours
                meant experimenting with different font weights and even shapes. At the same time, it was impressive to
                see all 8 typographic
                systems set up with the exact same text, yet they all looked so different. While completing these tasks
                we also had the weekly
                coding sheets. Each worksheet developed a range of different skills. These were helpful especially when
                it came to creating my
                own website. </div>

            <div class="RefPara">It was the exciting part. I had created a website from scratch previously for my A
                levels, I was enthusiastic to
                do it all again to a much higher standard. Started with a wireframe which gave me a layout of each
                webpage, which briefly stuck to
                for each page. Then the pretty part, the mood board. I began by combining the colours from my typography
                and my CARP posters to create
                a split complimentary colour palette in adobe. I continued this colour scheme throughout my website to
                ensure all pages and buttons
                matched. I included images from websites that inspired me with their layouts or features. I chose my
                font family when creating the
                mood board and used that same family throughout just changing sizes and weights. </div>

            <div class="RefPara">Originally, I planned on having the same carousel of images on each page, but I
                couldn’t decide what photos where
                relevant for each page. So, I used it on the About Me page so that I could use images of myself. The
                other layout feature that I
                changed was the navigation bar. In my wireframe it went navigation bar then title but in my final
                website it went title of page and
                then navigation bar. The buttons are white with black text and a yellow border, when a mouse hovers over
                each one they slowly go
                blue with white text still with the yellow border. All these colours came from my mood board and colour
                scheme. The buttons text
                size was medium so that the buttons all fit on one line even when the page is shrunk. Nearly all the
                pages have a “back to top”
                button for much easier navigation which saves scrolling all the way up creating a nicer user experience.
                On the CARP page a used
                a blue background for the first part of text so that it matched the main colours of the posters I
                created.

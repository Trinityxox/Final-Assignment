                <div class="mediacontent">Axial
                    Axial typography uses an imaginary line drawn from top to bottom of a glyph bisecting the upper and lower strokes.
                     To create an axial design, divide everything by an imaginary line (an axis). Axial designs arrange text in a way 
                     which fits onto a certain axis and can be either symmetrical or asymmetrical around their axis.

            <div class="section-four" id="secion-four">
                <div class="mediacontent">Radial
                    Radial typographic systems are when text is placed radioactively around a centre. Radial system gives people the
                     feeling that all the words are either spread out from a centre or coming together into a point. All elements extend 
                     from a point of focus.
                   
                </div>

                <div class="mediacontent">Dilatational
                Dilatational designs use type set along circular paths. the text forms curves around a point. The rings of a tree trunk 
                are a great example of dilatational design.

                <div class="mediacontent">Random
                    There are no rules for this style of typography. There's no right or wrong with this system. The text is in no specific 
                    layout itâ€™s just everywhere.

                <div class="mediacontent">Grid
                    A grid is a system of horizontal and vertical lines that can guide layout choices. Grids have been part of page layout
                     since the Gutenberg Bible.

                <div class="mediacontent">Modular
                    Modular layouts use repeating structures to break up the content. It is a repeatable structure that fits your content. 
                    For example, you could put everything into squares (which might end up looking like a grid) or circles (which could end
                     up looking like bubbles or clouds).

                <div class="mediacontent">Transitional
                    Transitional is the idea that text will flow in a natural way, it usually looks unorganised and isn't used for a lot of 
                    projects and is most often seen in books and movie posters.

            <div class="section-four" id="secion-four">
                <div class="mediacontent">Bilateral
                    The bilateral system is the most symmetrical of the visual organisation systems. It consists of a single axis. Placing
                     the axis off centre in the format can immediately make the composition more dynamic.
